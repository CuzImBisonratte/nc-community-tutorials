# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to set up an Etherpad instance on Ubuntu 20.04. Etherpad is a free and open source collaborative text-editor.
The time needed to follow this tutorial is approximately 10 - 20 minutes.

The tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 (July 2023).

The tutorial uses the example ip `123.123.123.123`.  
This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own server when you perform the steps described below.  
We will also use the domain `example.com` in this tutorial. Replace it with your own domain.

# Requirements

For private use a VPS 200 is sufficient.

I recommend setting up the instance on a VPS 200.  
If you feel like the instance is slowing down, you can always update to a bigger server trough the CCP.

The server needs to have Ubuntu 20.04 and SSH already installed.

<hr>

You will also need a domain. A domain used in a webhosting package is sufficient. (You can still use it for your webhosting, because we will use a subdomain.)

# Step 1 - Finding out the IP of your server

1. Log in to the SCP (ServerControlPanel) under https://www.servercontrolpanel.de.
2. Click on the server you want to use.
3. If you are already on the "General" tab, you'll see a pane labeled "Network" in the bottom right corner.
4. Here you can find the IP of your server (under IPv4).
5. Write the IP of your server down.

# Step 2 - Configuring DNS

1. Log in to the CCP (CustomerControlPanel) under https://www.customercontrolpanel.de.
2. In the sidebar on the left, click on "Domains".
3. Find the domain you want to use and click on the magnifying glass symbol next to it.
4. In the new window, click on "DNS".
5. Scroll down until there are empty fields.
6. In the first field, write your subdomain name (I recommend using "etherpad" or anything alike).
7. In the dropdown menu, select `A`.
8. In the last field, enter the IP of your server (from Step 1).
9. Click on "Save DNS records".

# Step 3 - Preparing the server

First you need to log in to your server via SSH, then follow these steps:

1. Enter `sudo -s` to get root privileges.
2. If asked for your password, enter it and press `Enter`.
3. If a pink window appears, press `Enter` once to continue.
4. Enter `curl https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh && bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh` to install NodeJS 16.
5. Enter `apt update -y && apt purge -y nginx apache2 lighttpd && apt autoremove -y && apt upgrade -y && apt install -y nodejs curl wget nginx git && adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" etherpad && sudo su etherpad` to install all the required software.
6. If a pink window appears, press `Enter` once to continue.
7. Enter `npm install npm -g` to update npm.

# Step 4 - Installing Etherpad

Enter the following command to install Etherpad:

1. Enter `cd ~ && git clone --branch master https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git && cd etherpad-lite` to clone the repository.
2. Enter `src/bin/run.sh ` to start Etherpad.

Once you see "Etherpad is running" in the terminal, proceed to the next step.

# Step 5 - Reverse Proxy with nginx

1. Enter `exit` to get back to root privileges.
2. If asked for your password, enter it and press `Enter`.
3. Enter `nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad` to create a new nginx config file.
4. Paste the following code into the file:

```nginx
server  {
    listen 80;
    # Remove '#' in the next line to enable IPv6
    # listen [::]:80;
    server_name    sub.domain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:9001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    }
}
```

5. Replace `sub.domain.com` with your subdomain (e.g. `etherpad.example.com`).
6. Exit the file by pressing `Ctrl + X` and then `Y` and then `Enter`.
7. Enter `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/etherpad` to enable the config file.
8. Enter `nginx -t` to test the config file.
9. If you see `test is successful`, you can reload nginx by entering `systemctl reload nginx`.

# Step 6 - Setting up Etherpad to start on boot

We want to start Etherpad automatically when the server starts.  
This is useful when the server reboots, as we cannot monitor the server running Kuma. When it is restarted, Kuma will also be restarted.

1. Enter `nano /etc/systemd/system/etherpad.service` to create a new systemd service file.
2. Paste the following code into the file:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Etherpad - A free and open source collaborative text-editor
Documentation=https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=etherpad
WorkingDirectory=/home/etherpad/etherpad-lite
ExecStart=src/bin/run.sh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Exit the file by pressing `Ctrl + X` and then `Y` and then `Enter`.
4. Enter `systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd daemon.
5. Enter `systemctl enable etherpad` to enable the service.
6. Enter `systemctl start etherpad` to start the service.

# Step 7 - Setting up HTTPS

1. Enter `snap install --classic certbot` to install CertBot.
2. Enter `certbot --nginx` to start the CertBot setup.
3. I recommend using these settings:
   1. Enter your email address.
   2. Yes (Terms of Service)
   3. No (Advertisement)
   4. Press `Enter` to select the only option (your domain).
   5. This process can take a while, so please be patient.

# Step 8 - Setting up the Firewall

We need a firewall to protect our server from unwanted connections.

We will use `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) to set up the firewall, because it is easy to use and configure and is also pre-installed on Ubuntu.

1. Enter `ufw allow ssh` to allow SSH connections.
2. Enter `ufw allow http` to allow HTTP connections.
3. Enter `ufw allow https` to allow HTTPS connections.
4. Enter `ufw enable` to enable the firewall.
5. Press `Y` and then `Enter` to confirm.

# Conclusion

Now you have successfully installed Etherpad and set it up to start on boot.

From now on your Etherpad instance will be available under your subdomain (e.g. `https://etherpad.example.com`).

Thank you for using this tutorial!
